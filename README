                        plot.phylo widget v1.0

To be used & abused :)

________________________________________________________________________________
                            RUNNING

Script needs the following R packages installed:
* gWidgets
* ape
* ggplot2
* cairoDevice


Run it by executing PlotPhylo.r script (remember to adjust the path).
* The "Open" button is for loading single tree files (.nex, .tree).

* "New" opens a new tab for other phylographic trees. The usefull backproduct 
  is it will also catch any other plots R produces while the widget is opened. 

* "Close" closes the currently opened tab.

* "Save" saves the current plot in eps format (vector graphic). 

* "Quit" is obvious :)
